    <h1>Links</h1>
    <!-- href is an attribute of the anchor element, it lives inside of the opening tag. Syntax: attribute-name="value"-->
    <p>This example is about links and <a href="images.html">images</a>.</p>

    <p>This particular page is about links! There are three kind of links:</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- Absolute links are the most detailed way you can refer to a web resource. -->
      <!-- start with scheme = http:// or https://, domain name, path of target web page -->
      <!-- Used for directing to a different website -->
      <!-- The target attribute defines where to display the page _blank = new tab -->
      <li>Absolute links, like to
         <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
         target="_blank">Mozilla Developer Network</a>,
         which is a very good resource for web developers.</li>
      <!-- Relative links point to another file in your website from the file your editing= only path -->
      <!-- include the full path from current folder to target folder -->
      <li>Relative links, like to our <a href="misc/extras.html">extras page</a>.</li>
      <!-- This won't work for our local HTML files -->
      <li>Root-relative links, like to the <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website,
        but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
    </ul>
