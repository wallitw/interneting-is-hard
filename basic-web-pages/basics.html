    <!-- Add header element -->
    <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
    <!-- Add paragraph element -->
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <!-- There are six levels of headings, browsers render less important headings in smaller fonts. -->
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <!-- Add unordered list element -->
    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element, it stands for unordered list</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>

     <!-- Add ordered list element -->
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

     <!-- Add Inline elements -->
    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
